# Project-BO4-Safe

A custom *Call of Duty: Black Ops 4* (BO4) client that **uses custom community servers** and **removes the Battle.NET online connection requirement**, allowing players to continue enjoying BO4 outside of the official infrastructure.  

> **Note:** This client currently shows **12 flags on VirusTotal** but **none on Bitdefender**.  
> These may be **false positives** due to the nature of custom launchers or modified executables.  
> Always verify software independently and proceed with caution.

## Features

- **Custom Community Servers** – Connect to fan-hosted servers instead of relying on official servers.  
- **Battle.NET Requirement Removal** – Allows you to launch the game without a direct connection to Battle.NET.  
- **Adapted Launcher** – Based on open-source work from other BO4 projects (see [Credits](#credits)).

## How It Works

1. **No DRM Removal**  
   - This project does **not** remove or circumvent DRM in the traditional sense. Instead, it **modifies** how BO4 connects to servers.  
2. **Custom Server Infrastructure**  
   - You’ll connect to servers hosted by the community, ensuring that you can still play if official services are unavailable.  
3. **User-Provided Game Files**  
   - You **must own** a legal copy of *Call of Duty: Black Ops 4*. No copyrighted game files are included here.

## Getting Started

1. **Obtain Game Files**  
   - Ensure you have a valid copy of BO4 installed or game files on hand.

2. **Download / Clone This Project**  
   - Head to the [releases](../../releases) and download the latest version of the client.

3. **Run the Launcher**  
   - Execute the provided launcher (`project-bo4.exe`) with the files provided in the game's folder, which means you HAVE to extract them there, check [community servers](https://discord.com/invite/AXECAzJJGU) on discord if you face any problems.

4. **Play and Enjoy!**  
   - Launch the game and have fun on custom servers.
